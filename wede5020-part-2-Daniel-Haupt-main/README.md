Web Development POE Part 1 & 2
Daniel Haupt
ST10492718

The goal and objective of this project is to create a website that will be used to improve upon an existing website / non-existing website.
Some key features from the current website would be the working links and back to top feature.
I've created the website over the past months August and September. I have been able to achieve a decent website.
